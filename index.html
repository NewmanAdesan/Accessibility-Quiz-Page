  OUTSTANDING LESSONS LEARNED

  * The Lang attribute:
        assist {screen readers} in identifying the language of the page.



  * Meta element:
        I had more familiarity with meta.
        It is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author, viewport definition, description definition, character encoding.

        a viewport definition tells the browser how to render the page.
        Including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, 
        and improves SEO (search engine optimization).

        the description definition is an important meta element for accessibility and SEO. The value of the "content attribute" is used by {search engines} to provide a description of your page.



  * Title element(screen-reader):
        the title element is useful for screen readers to understand the content of a page. Furthermore, it is an important part of SEO.



  * Navigation:
        Navigation is a core part of accessibility, and {screen readers} rely on you to provide the structure of your page. This is accomplished with semantic HTML elements e.g header, main, footer elements e.t.c 

        header element will be used to introduce the page, as well as provide a navigation menu.



  * A property of SVG images:
        A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that 
        it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled 
        without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.



  * aspect-ration property:
        The aspect ratio of an element describes 
        the proportional relationship between its width and its height.

        aspect-ration: auto|initial|inherit|revert|revert-layer|unset|<ratio>

        The box's preferred aspect ratio is the specified ratio of width / height. If height and the preceding slash character are omitted, height defaults to 1.



  * the max/min function:
        using this function to choose between two or more values 
        depending on which is maximum/minumum.

        In this function is a list of comma separated values
        where which the maximum/minumum value is chosen



  * max-width/min-width propety (wrap-around control):

        with width property, e.g {width: 500px}...
        when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). 
        The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

        But if you don't want this scrolling, 
        you can set {max-width: 500px}....
        when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px), the element will wrap around.
        Meaning "max-width property" specifies when to start wrapping.
        Meaning the maximum width to get to before wrapping starts.

        "min-width property" specifies 
        when to stop wrapping and 
        add the horizontal scroll bar feature. pretty cool
        Meaning the minimum width to get to before the 
        horizontal scrolling feature is added.



  * section element (semantically separating form element):
        Just like fieldset element,
        section element separate the content within the form
        but does this semantically.
        that is you wont see physical changes

  

  * role attribute:
        To increase the page accessibility, 
        the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose 
        behind an element on the page to assistive technologies.
        The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), """ and accepts preset values """.
        I used the region value on the section element



  * aria-labelledby attribute:
        This attribute, labels a region.
        Every region role requires a visible label, which should be referenced by the aria-labelledby attribute.



  * nav element:
        This is a container which contains text,
        that can be used to move to different part of
        the page.

        Whereby the text can act as a link to different
        part of the page.
        anchor tags is used on the text,
        with the id of the "element to link to" as its href attribute.



  * "label element" to "input element" (for attribute):
        It is important to link each input to the corresponding label element.
        This provides assistive technology users with a visual reference to the input.

        This is done by giving the label a for attribute, which contains the id of the input.



  * Best practice (input element):
        Keeping in mind best-practices for form inputs, give each input an appropriate type and name attribute.
        also using required property if needed



  * NOT Best practice (placeholder property):
        Now, be sure to note why is not best for accessibility.

        using placeholder property is actually not a best-practice for accessibility;
        too often, users confuse the placeholder text with an actual input value - they think there is already a value in the input.



  * position property:
        This property is a dual property.
        It is affiliated with another type of property that 
        specifies actual position of the element

        The "position property" specifies the type of 
        positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky). 
        Elements are then positioned using the "top, bottom, left, and right properties". 
        However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. 
        They also work differently depending on the position value.

        position: static|relative|fixed|absolute|sticky



  * Positioning things on image:
        You can even position text on an image, with this trick.
        setting up a container to house the image and text. then position text relative to container by using the 'absolute value'...Pretty Cool.

        you can reduce the opacity of the image.



  * overflow property:
        The CSS overflow property controls what happens to 
        content that is too big to fit into an area. 
        The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars 
        when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

        overflow: visible|hidden|scroll|auto
        overflow-x: specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.
        overflow-y: specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.



  * clip property:
        The clip property lets you specify a rectangle 
        to clip an absolutely positioned element. This rectangle act as a window, 
        only through this rectangle, can you see the element.

        The rectangle is specified as four coordinates, 
        all from the top-left corner of the element to be clipped.

        similar to overflow: hidden,
        but this time, instead of clipping based on the size of the
        element. you can specify a box size to clip the element.

        Think of it like putting a rectangle on the element.

        Note: overflow should not be visible
              position should be absolute



  * white-space property:
        The white-space property specifies how white-space inside an element is handled. 
        it also specifies how characters behave in an element. 
        do that stay as they are, wrap around, no wraping at all e.t.c

        white-space: normal|nowrap|pre|pre-line|pre-wrap|initial|inherit;


            normal: Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. 
                    Text will wrap when necessary. This is default
            
            nowrap: Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. 
                    Text will never wrap to the next line. 
                    The text continues on the same line until a <br> tag is encountered.
            
            pre: Whitespace is preserved by the browser. 
                 Text will only wrap on line breaks. Acts like the <pre> tag in HTML

            pre-line: Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. 
                      Text will wrap when necessary, and on line breaks

            pre-wrap: Whitespace is preserved by the browser. 
                      Text will wrap when necessary, and on line breaks

            initial: Sets this property to its default value.

            inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element.



  * Text only the Screen Reader can read:
        This is actually an impressive technique.

        .sr-only {
          position: absolute;
          width: 1px;
          height: 1px;
          white-space: nowrap;
          
          overflow: hidden;
          clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);

          padding: 0;
          margin: -1px;
          border: 0;
        }

        think about it.

        we make the text position absolute so it takes real space
        on the page. meaning all things can be in the space where
        the text is. meaning there can be overlap

        Next, we made the width and height of the element so small.

        Next, we specify nowrapping for the text.

        Next, we use overflow to clip out text outside the element
        size which is 1px by 1px. this means the text will not show.

        Next, we clip the element completely, no window.

        Actually, with position, overflow and clip we can achieve the same result.




  * ::before, ::after pseudoelement,:

        This guess target immediately after/before
        an element. they are initially empty, except styled otherwise


  * Content property:

        The content property can be used with the ::before, ::after pseudoelement
        to insert generated content to the target element

        content: normal|none|counter|attr|string|open-quote|close-quote|no-open-quote|no-close-quote|url|initial|inherit;




  * footer/address element:

        The footer element is a container for 
        a collection of content that is related to the page,

        the address element is a container for contact 
        information for the author of the page.



  * Constrast (visual accessibility):

        We measure contrast between text/graphics 
        against the background color/ background image
        This is called CONSTRAST RATIO

        A white text on a white background has a 
        contrast ratio of 1. This is impossible to perceive.

        Black text on a white background has a contrast ratio of 21. 

        There is no perfect ratio. According to Apple, 
        we should strive for a minimum of 4.5, 
        although 7 is preferred.

        To measure contrast on text on top of a background image, 
        we need to find the brightest or darkest part of the image. 
        If the text is bright, look for the brightest part and vice versa.

        Any interactive component has different states – 
        hover, focus, active, unvisited, visited and deactivated. 
        Remember to ensure that the states also have good contrast.

        Online tools: 
              "contrast-ratio.com" -> supports multiple color format (RGB, HSL, hex, RGBA) 
              "color picker from webfx.com"
              "htmlcolors/color-converter"




  * Cursor property:

        This specifies how the mouse cursor would
        be displayed when pointing over an element.

        There are like 30 different mouse cursor display. PRETTY COOL!!





  * display: inline VS display: inline-block

        Compared to "inline", the major difference is that
        "inline-block" allows to set a width and height on the element.

        Also, with "inline-block", 
        the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected
        whereas with "inline" they are not




  * display: block VS display: inline-block

        Compared to "block", 
        the major difference is that "inline-block" 
        does not add a line-break after the element, 
        so the element can sit next to other elements.




  * scroll-behaviour property:

        Clicking on the navigation links should jump 
        the viewport to the relevant section. 
        However, this jumping can be disorienting for some users.

        The scroll-behavior property specifies 
        whether to smoothly animate the scroll position, 
        instead of a straight jump, 
        when the user clicks on a link within a scrollable box.

        By setting scroll-behavior: smooth



  * Media-rule (prefers-reduced-motion):

        Setting the scroll-behavior to smooth is preferred by most users.
        However, some users find this to be too slow, 
        and prefer to have the scrolling happen instantaneously.

        There exists a media rule to set CSS based on the user's browser settings called 
        PREFERS-REDUCED-MOTION

        This accepts one of two values "reduce" & "no-preference"

        We can specify within a prefers-reduced-motion media rule whose user's browser setting is "no-preference"
        that the scroll-behaviour should be smooth.

        VIA  @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)




  * Access Key attribute:

        the navigation accessibility can be improved by providing keyboard shortcuts.
        The accesskey attribute accepts a space-separated list of access keys.

        For example: <button type="submit" accesskey="s">Submit</button>

        Note: It is not always advised to use access keys, but they can be useful.


  * Text-Decoration property:



  * padding-inline-start property:


  * list-style property (removing bullet point):
